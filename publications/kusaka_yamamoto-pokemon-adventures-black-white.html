                    For being a long time fan of the Pokémon series, it is a bit of a surprise even to myself that only now I would finally end up
                    reading the manga series. Although I had never put any thought into it directly, I imagine I'd avoided it because I found it
                    more akin to a marketing product than a work of art. Nevertheless, I read through the whole thing, and I can safely say that
                    it was blast of a read. Pokémon Black & White always had a special place in my heart, so having my first read of the manga be
                    in Unova sealed the deal; I enjoyed every bit of it.

                    Pokémon Adventures: Black & White tells the tale of a young boy who dreams of conquering the Pokémon League and becoming the 
                    greatest of them all; so far, so Pokémon. But the story would not be as unique, as special, without N. He is one of the best
                    characters in the whole franchise - in my opinion. So having him battle against Black, not only with Pokémon, but also in
                    ideology, provides one of the most interesting hero-villain dynamic I'd ever seen.

                    While the story is, without a doubt, aimed towards a younger audience, it is not without its symbolisms and messages. For me 
                    the biggest point the manga brings is dreams. Black, the protagonist, is a character filled with dreams, so much so, that he
                    needs help from Musha, Black's Munna, to rid his mind of his dreams, so he can think straight. Throughout the story we see
                    Black chase after his dreams and, most specially for me, how his dreams blur and wain as he finds struggles in his journey. By
                    the end, Black finds himself disheartened, questioning whether he would ever achieve his dreams. However, in spite of his 
                    worries, Black is capable of refueling his dreams and relighting the flame in his heart, with the help of his friends and his 
                    Pokémon - it is truly a very touching moment. Perhaps as a nod to us, the adults, the manga has Black encounter a varied 
                    amount of people in his path to the Pokémon League; each one a person who had dreams in their youth, but let them fade away as
                    they got older. The manga shows these people being influenced by Black's determination towards achieving his dreams; each and
                    every one of them was capable of rekindling their hopes and dreams.

                    Most unexpectedly, the manga ends with a tragic note and a cliffhanger towards the next series (Pokémon Black 2 & White 2). I 
                    look forward to purchasing the other series, because I will enjoy just as much as I did this one. As mentioned, I had never 
                    given much thought to the manga dimension of Pokémon and I regret doing so; as a result, the remaining manga series, from 
                    Kanto to Alola, are now a top priority in my reading list. For a recommendation, although I think the manga will be best enjoyed
                    by Pokémon fans, I also think that people unfamiliar with the franchise will be able to enjoy it a lot.

                    My praises to Hidenori Kusaka and Satoshi Yamamoto; I can wait to see what else these guys have come up with.
