            <h2 class="book-title">Out of the silent planet</h2>
            <p class="book-author">by C. S. Lewis</p>
            <div class="publication">
                <p class="review-paragraph">
                    In "Out of the silent planet", the reader explores the wonders involved in the discovery a new 
                    world: the fascination with the an unexplored culture and ambient, but also the strangeness in
                    overcoming the barrier of mistrust between different species. The book provides a rich cast of
                    different species and their cultures, but also accentuating the differences (or lack there of) 
                    between the unknown species of Malacandra and the humans from Earth.
                </p>
                <p class="review-paragraph">
                    The book has a great emphasis on the religious aspect of the people of Malacandra. It also has
                    shy but present references to Christianity - explaining that their religion is not distinct 
                    from our own. What the book does not do, however, is to try and evangelize the reader; any 
                    religious mentions are always low-profile, rarely name-dropping literal references to the gospel.
                </p>
                <p class="review-paragraph">
                    Another point of praise is regarding the topic of space colonization. Unlike Asimov's of Frank
                    Herbert's approach, C. S. Lewis does not ask: "What needs to be done so humanity can live on?"
                    Rather, the question is much less about how and much more about if. The author proposes the 
                    idea that all things have their time under the sun, and the we should rejoice in the time we 
                    have. To reinforce this idea, the book also expresses that "pleasure" and "remembrance" are 
                    not made separately; it states that if something brings you pleasure, you should try and
                    retain that memory, so the simple thought of it can bring again the pleasure felt at the time.

                    One, however, cannot talk about "Out of the silent planet" without mentioning the philology in
                    it. Ransom's discovery of the foreign language of the hrossa is a marvel in of itself. The 
                    author explores masterfully the complexities in learning a new language. It puts to proof the
                    comment that many people who decide to move abroad say: "What you learn in six years in 
                    school, you learn in six months by simply being there". Being forcefully immersed in a world 
                    where you need to communicate to survive, but no one speaks your language, is perhaps the best
                    representation of Ransom's journey to Malacandra. For me, at least, the icing on the cake was 
                    his lack of fluency by the end of the story; having the character master a totally unique 
                    language, that differs from every known language, would most certainly detract from the 
                    story's merits. 
                </p>
                <p class="review-paragraph">
                    As anything in life, the book is not without its faults. I like to thing of them as mechanical
                    faults during the writing process. One example is Ransom's watch: during his journey through
                    the harandra to reach Oyarsa, Ransom is accompanied by one of the natives; when their travel
                    reaches the destination and they part ways, Ransom tries to give the native his own watch; the
                    native does not accept the gift, saying that it would be best given to another native. After
                    that, however, Ransom's watch is not mentioned ever again. Mishaps such as this happen quite
                    infrequently and do not subtract in any way from the story at large.
                </p>
                <p class="review-paragraph">
                    Overall, "Out of the silent planet" is a read that can be enjoyed and understood by a great
                    audience. Although it evokes an exploration of the unknown, it is not overly abstract as was
                    Arthur C. Clarke's "Rendevouz with Rama" and every alien aspect can be understood with ease.
                    As mentioned, the religious aspect is very present, but are more philosophical than preachy. 
                    Even a reader with only little knowledge of religion should be able to understand the message.
                    The book, hopefully, bring the reader to think about the future of the human race, the joys of
                    life, the challenges in learning a new language, how one views their memories and the influence 
                    of evil in a society.
