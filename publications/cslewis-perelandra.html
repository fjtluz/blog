            <h2 class="book-title">Perelandra</h2>
            <p class="book-author">by C. S. Lewis</p>
            <div class="publication">
                <p>
                    When C. S. Lewis stated in the foreword that "Perelandra" would be a sequel to <a href="./cslewis-out-of-the-silent-planet.html">"Out of the 
                    silent planet"</a>, and at the same time a standalone experience, I concede that, upon embarking 
                    on a new read, I did not fully understand what he meant. Now, as I have completed the Journey 
                    to Venus, I can safely affirm that, although "Perelandra" borrows many aspects from its 
                    predecessor, it is far from a continuation of the narative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the religious aspect of the prequel was vague and unintrusive, in "Perelandra", it is a
                    central aspect of the narrative. The author brings great exposition to Christianity and the
                    duality between good and evil; with parallels between Eden and the first sin. Perhaps in
                    challenge, the author brings out false truths - misinterpretations of the gospel -, exploring
                    the dichotomy between light and dark, between good and evil, between God and the Devil. But he
                    does not try to hammer on this believes upon the reader, rather the contrary: he exposes them 
                    as possible truths, but then brings arguments that ultimately reveal their true light and 
                    confirm them to be nothing more than beautiful lies.

                <p>
                    The first half of the story explores the "angel and devil on each shoulder" dynamic, but the
                    second halve went in a direction I was not expecting. At the end, "this cannot go further" won 
                    against "something needs to be done". As a result the reader is left wandering what could have
                    been. But perhaps this is the overall message, sometimes, things simply go the way they need 
                    to go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For my taste, "Perelandra" greatest fault is its excess of reveries and descriptions, somewhat
                    akin to J. R. R. Tolkien's style - a characteristic that was not at all present in the 
                    prequel. There are times when I felt out of the loop, not really understanding what the 
                    character was talking about, or how things would be relevant to the overarching story; in most 
                    cases, it felt like fodder, to eat up words and to fatten the pages. Nonetheless, I sincerely 
                    assume that it probably was my fault and that a second read might be warranted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, "Perelandra" is an enjoyable read. Although, I do think that I would require a second
                    read in order to fully understand the message, but that will need to wait for another time.
                    Now knowing it to be  a very concrete standalone story, reading it with this in mind may help
                    to fill the gaps and give me a better perspective on the nature of the story.
